    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  I wanted to create an easy to use inventory app for small businesses and hobbyists to use. There is a login, sms feature, and dynamic table. I kept it simple and touch friendly for phone use.
    
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I followed the android guidelines for design and started by making a wireframe. Then I made a mock up in android studio. Finally, I made a working model. 
    
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
    Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I couldn't get the android emulator to work for some reason. For the UI, I asked my bf if he thinks it looks usable for my target audience and I settled on a design that worked. What I would've done had I got the emulator working is try adding inventory items hard coded in to make sure it worked, and then replace them with dynamic options. When I made my mock up, I had hard coded values to see how it looked. For the final product I changed to recyclerview to have dynamic changable values.


    In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I am happy with my choice of login. Since you can have sms notifications, I made the username section be your phone number. That way you could easily get the number for notifications
